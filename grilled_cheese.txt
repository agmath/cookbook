Ingredients (1 sandwich)

2 slices good bread
Sourdough or a sturdy white sandwich bread works best. Avoid very airy bread.

2–3 slices cheese (about 2–3 oz total)
Best options:

Sharp cheddar (flavor)

American (melting)

Gruyère (depth)
Pro move: 1 slice American + 1 slice sharp cheddar.

1½–2 tbsp butter, softened
(Salted preferred)

Optional (use sparingly):

Dijon mustard (a thin smear inside)

A few caramelized onions

Freshly cracked black pepper

Method

Preheat the pan

Use a nonstick or cast-iron skillet.

Heat over medium-low. This is critical. Rushing ruins grilled cheese.

Butter the bread

Butter one side of each slice evenly, edge to edge.

Don’t butter the pan. Butter belongs on the bread.

Assemble in the pan

Place one slice butter-side down.

Add cheese (keep it inside the edges).

Top with the second slice, butter-side up.

Cook slowly

Cook 3–4 minutes until the bottom is deeply golden.

Flip carefully.

Cook another 3–4 minutes.

Press lightly

Use a spatula to gently press once or twice.

You’re encouraging contact, not making a panini.

Rest (briefly)

Remove from heat and let sit 30–60 seconds.

This improves texture and prevents molten-cheese burn.
