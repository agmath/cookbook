How to make overnight cinnamon rolls
After the first rise, roll the cinnamon rolls up, cut them as directed, and arrange them in a pan lined with parchment paper.
Cover the pan well with plastic wrap, then place them in the fridge overnight. They can stay in the fridge for up to 18 hours from the time you place them in there — no more!
When you are ready to bake, bring the cinnamon rolls to room temperature and let them rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Bake as directed, then frost & devour!
