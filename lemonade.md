Classic Homemade Lemonade

Ingredients

1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 4–6 lemons)

1 cup granulated sugar

5–6 cups cold water (to taste)

Ice

Optional: lemon slices or mint for garnish

Instructions

Make a simple syrup
In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1 cup of water. Heat gently, stirring, until the sugar fully dissolves. Let it cool.
(This step prevents gritty lemonade and gives better flavor balance.)

Juice the lemons
Roll them on the counter first to get more juice, then squeeze and strain out seeds.

Mix
In a pitcher, combine the lemon juice, cooled simple syrup, and 4 cups of cold water.

Adjust
Taste and add more water for a lighter lemonade or more lemon juice for extra tartness.

Serve
Add ice and garnish if you like.
