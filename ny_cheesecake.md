New York–Style Cheesecake (9-inch)
Ingredients
Crust

1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs (about 10–12 full crackers)

2 tbsp sugar

6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted

Pinch of salt

Filling

32 oz (4 blocks) full-fat cream cheese, room temperature

1 cup granulated sugar

3 tbsp all-purpose flour or 2 tbsp cornstarch (classic NY texture)

1 tsp salt

1 tbsp vanilla extract

Zest of 1 lemon (optional but very traditional)

4 large eggs, room temperature

¾ cup full-fat sour cream

¼ cup heavy cream

Instructions
1. Prep the Pan

Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C).

Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan tightly in 2–3 layers of foil (water bath insurance).

Lightly grease the inside.

2. Make the Crust

Mix crumbs, sugar, salt, and melted butter until it looks like wet sand.

Press firmly into the bottom of the pan (flat-bottomed glass works great).

Bake for 10 minutes, then cool while you make the filling.

3. Make the Filling (Low and Slow!)

Beat cream cheese on low speed until completely smooth (no lumps).

Add sugar and beat just until combined.

Mix in flour/cornstarch, salt, vanilla, and lemon zest.

Add eggs one at a time, mixing on low and stopping as soon as each is incorporated.

Gently mix in sour cream and heavy cream.

Key rule: Don’t whip air into it. Air = cracks.

4. Water Bath

Place pan in a large roasting pan.

Pour hot water around it, about halfway up the sides.

Carefully transfer to oven.

5. Bake

Bake at 325°F for 70–85 minutes.

The edges should be set, but the center should still jiggle like Jell-O, not slosh.

6. Cool Gradually (Crack Prevention)

Turn oven off.

Crack oven door and let cheesecake sit 1 hour.

Remove from water bath and cool at room temp another hour.

Refrigerate at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.

Serving

Run a knife around the edge before releasing the springform.

Serve plain (NY purist move) or with:

Fresh berries

Strawberry compote

A light sour cream topping

Pro Tips (Very NY)

Use Philadelphia cream cheese if you can.

No whipped cream, no gelatin, no shortcuts.

Cheesecake tastes best day 2, not day 1.
